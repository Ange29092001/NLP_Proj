# NLP_Proj
This is repository with some basic NLP projects. It includes : 
1. Sentiment Analysis
2. LDA_Topic Modelling
3. LSTM Classification

Finally in the project, we will be looking at the development of a text classification model using an approach based on the integration of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model in an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture.
